Many driveway problems build slowly, then become expensive all at once.

The right question is not just **if** you should regrade, but **when**.

## Signs It Is Time to Regrade

If you see one or more of these consistently, it is usually time:

- Wheel-track ruts getting deeper
- Washboard texture that keeps returning
- Water pooling in the same low areas
- Gravel drifting heavily to the edges
- Soft spots near turns, parking zones, or entrances

## Regrade Early vs Wait Longer

Regrading earlier is usually cheaper because:

- You are correcting shape before bigger failure points develop
- You need less material replacement
- You reduce water damage from repeated pooling

Waiting too long can turn a maintenance job into a larger rebuild scope.

## Seasonal Timing for Vancouver Island

The best window is usually:

- **Spring through fall** for cleaner surface finishing and compaction

You can still do urgent corrections in wetter periods, but full profile resets are often more efficient in drier windows.

## How Often Should You Regrade?

There is no single schedule for every property.

Frequency depends on:

- Driveway traffic volume
- Drainage behavior
- Length/slope of the driveway
- Material depth and quality

Some properties need occasional touchups; others benefit from a regular seasonal reset.

## When Regrading Alone Is Not Enough

If the surface is very thin or consistently soft, regrading may need to be paired with fresh aggregate.

That combination usually gives better durability and fewer repeat issues.

## Quick Next Step

If you can point out where water sits and where the driveway feels unstable, it is easier to confirm whether your property needs:

1. Regrade only
2. Regrade plus aggregate top-up
3. Larger section correction
