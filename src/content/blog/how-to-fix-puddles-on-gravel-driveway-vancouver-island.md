If puddles keep coming back, adding random gravel often does not solve it for long.

Most standing water issues come from **shape and runoff flow**, not just missing rock.

## Why Puddles Form

Common causes on gravel driveways:

- Low spots created by traffic
- Flattened crown (water no longer sheds to sides)
- Poor edge definition and runoff path
- Soft base sections that trap water

## Fast Self-Check

After rain, walk the driveway and note:

- Where water sits longest
- Whether water is trapped in wheel tracks
- If the center is lower than edges
- If problem spots repeat in the same locations

This tells you whether you need reshaping, new aggregate, or both.

## Fix Path 1: Re-Grade for Drainage

Best when the driveway still has usable material.

Typical scope:

- Re-level surface
- Restore crown and slope
- Correct low spots
- Compact for stability

## Fix Path 2: Add Aggregate + Finish Grade

Best when the top layer is too thin or soft.

Typical scope:

- Bring in fresh aggregate
- Fill weak and low areas
- Spread and level across traffic lanes
- Final grade for runoff

## Practical Prevention Tips

- Avoid letting wheel ruts deepen over multiple seasons
- Address edge washout early
- Do a seasonal surface reset before major failure points form

Small corrections early are usually cheaper than full rebuild work later.

## Vancouver Island Timing

The strongest window for durable driveway correction is usually spring through fall, when finishing and compaction conditions are more consistent.

If you are seeing recurring puddles now, a quick assessment can confirm the right fix before the problem spreads.
