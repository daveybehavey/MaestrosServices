Fall in British Columbia is the perfect time to prepare your yard for winter. A thorough cleanup now prevents problems in spring and keeps your property looking tidy through the wet season.

## Why Fall Cleanup Matters

Vancouver Island's wet winters can wreak havoc on neglected yards:

- Fallen leaves trap moisture and promote disease
- Debris left on lawns can kill grass underneath
- Uncleared garden beds attract pests
- Overgrown plants become damaged by winter storms

A proper fall cleanup protects your investment and makes spring maintenance much easier.

## Complete Fall Cleanup Checklist

### Lawn Care

**Clear fallen leaves** - Don't let leaves sit on your lawn. They block sunlight and trap moisture, creating conditions for fungal diseases.

**Final mowing** - Continue mowing until the grass stops growing, usually late October or early November. Gradually lower your mowing height for the last few cuts.

**Overseed thin areas** - Fall is actually an excellent time to overseed on Vancouver Island. The mild temperatures and regular rainfall help new grass establish.

**Apply fall fertilizer** - A fall fertilizer with higher potassium helps strengthen roots for winter dormancy.

### Garden Beds

**Cut back perennials** - Most perennials benefit from being cut back in fall. Leave about 2-3 inches of stems.

**Remove annuals** - Clear out dead annual plants and add them to your compost.

**Add mulch** - A 2-3 inch layer of mulch protects plant roots from temperature fluctuations and suppresses winter weeds.

**Divide overcrowded plants** - Fall is ideal for dividing hostas, daylilies, and other perennials.

### Trees and Shrubs

**Prune dead branches** - Remove any dead or damaged branches before winter storms can cause them to fall.

**Clear fallen debris** - Rake up fallen leaves and branches from under trees.

**Protect young trees** - Consider wrapping the trunks of young or thin-barked trees to prevent frost cracking.

### Hardscape and Structures

**Clean gutters** - Remove fallen leaves from gutters and downspouts.

**Store outdoor furniture** - Clean and store or cover outdoor furniture.

**Winterize irrigation** - Drain and shut off irrigation systems to prevent frozen pipes.

**Clear pathways** - Remove debris from walkways and patios to prevent slipping.

## Timing Your Fall Cleanup

For Vancouver Island, aim to complete your fall cleanup:

- **Early tasks (September)**: Final fertilizing, dividing perennials
- **Mid-fall (October)**: Leaf removal, cutting back plants, mulching
- **Late fall (November)**: Final mowing, gutter cleaning, winterizing

## What to Do with Yard Waste

Vancouver Island has several options for yard waste:

- **Municipal green bins** - Most municipalities accept yard waste curbside
- **Composting** - Leaves and small debris make excellent compost
- **Yard waste drop-off** - Local recycling centers accept larger quantities
- **Professional haul-away** - For large cleanups, professional removal saves time
