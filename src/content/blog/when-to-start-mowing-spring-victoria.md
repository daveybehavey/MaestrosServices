One of the most common questions we get from homeowners in Victoria and the surrounding area is "When should I start mowing my lawn in spring?" The answer depends on several factors specific to our mild coastal climate.

## The Short Answer

In the Greater Victoria area, most lawns are ready for their first mow between **mid-March and early April**. However, the exact timing varies based on:

- Your specific microclimate
- How much sun your lawn gets
- Soil drainage conditions
- The type of grass you have

## Signs Your Lawn is Ready

Don't go by the calendar alone. Look for these indicators:

### 1. Active Growth

Your grass should be actively growing, not just green from winter. New growth will appear brighter green than dormant grass.

### 2. Grass Height

Wait until your lawn reaches at least 3-4 inches tall. This ensures the grass has enough leaf surface to photosynthesize after cutting.

### 3. Dry Soil

The ground should be firm enough to walk on without leaving footprints. Our wet Vancouver Island winters often keep soil soggy into March.

### 4. Consistent Temperatures

Daytime temperatures should consistently reach 10°C or higher. In Victoria and Saanich, this typically happens by mid-March.

## First Mow Best Practices

When you do make that first cut:

**Set your mower high** - For the first mow, set your blade at 3-4 inches. This reduces stress on grass that's just coming out of dormancy.

**Remove only one-third** - Never cut more than one-third of the grass blade in a single mowing. If your lawn is very tall, you may need multiple sessions to bring it down to regular height.

**Sharpen your blade** - A dull blade tears grass rather than cutting it cleanly, making your lawn more susceptible to disease.

**Mow when dry** - Wait for a dry day. Wet grass clogs mowers and doesn't cut evenly.

## Timing by Area

Different parts of Greater Victoria warm up at different rates:

| Area | Typical First Mow |
|------|-------------------|
| Victoria (downtown) | Mid-March |
| Saanich (urban) | Mid-March |
| Langford | Late March |
| View Royal | Late March |
| Metchosin/Highlands | Early April |
| Central Saanich | Late March |

Areas closer to the water tend to warm up faster, while higher elevations and more rural areas may stay cool longer.

## What Happens If You Start Too Early?

Mowing too early can:

- Stress grass that hasn't fully woken from dormancy
- Compact waterlogged soil
- Damage grass crowns in soft ground
- Spread disease through wet conditions

It's better to wait a week or two than to damage your lawn by starting too soon.

## What If You Start Too Late?

Starting late isn't ideal either:

- Overgrown grass is harder to cut
- You may need to mow multiple times to reach proper height
- Weeds get a head start
- Lawn looks unkempt

If you've let your lawn get too long, raise your mower to its highest setting and gradually reduce the height over several mowings.

## Setting Up a Mowing Schedule

Once you start mowing, plan to continue weekly or bi-weekly through the growing season:

- **March-April**: Every 10-14 days (growth is slower)
- **May-June**: Weekly (peak growing season)
- **July-August**: Every 7-10 days (growth slows in heat)
- **September-October**: Every 10-14 days
- **November**: Final mow, then winter break
