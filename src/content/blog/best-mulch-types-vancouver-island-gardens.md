Mulch is one of the most beneficial additions you can make to your Vancouver Island garden. It conserves moisture, suppresses weeds, regulates soil temperature, and improves soil health over time. But with so many options available, which type is best for our coastal climate?

## Why Mulch Matters on Vancouver Island

Our unique climate creates specific mulching needs:

- **Wet winters** - Mulch helps prevent soil erosion and compaction
- **Dry summers** - Retains moisture during drought periods
- **Mild temperatures** - Allows for year-round mulching
- **Active soil life** - Organic mulches break down and feed the soil

## Organic Mulch Options

### Bark Mulch

**Best for:** Garden beds, around trees and shrubs, pathways

Bark mulch is the most popular choice on Vancouver Island. It's readily available, affordable, and lasts 2-3 years before needing replacement.

**Pros:**
- Natural appearance
- Slow to decompose
- Good weed suppression
- Available in various sizes (fine, medium, coarse)

**Cons:**
- Can float away in heavy rain if not settled
- May temporarily tie up nitrogen as it decomposes

**Cost:** $30-50 per cubic yard

### Cedar Mulch

**Best for:** Areas prone to pests, around sensitive plants

Cedar mulch is popular for its natural insect-repelling properties and pleasant scent.

**Pros:**
- Natural pest deterrent
- Pleasant aroma
- Attractive reddish color
- Long-lasting (3-4 years)

**Cons:**
- More expensive than bark mulch
- Strong scent may be overwhelming for some
- Color fades over time

**Cost:** $45-70 per cubic yard

### Arborist Wood Chips

**Best for:** Large areas, naturalized gardens, pathways, around established trees

Often available free or cheap from local tree services, arborist chips are a budget-friendly option.

**Pros:**
- Often free or very cheap
- Good for large areas
- Natural look
- Excellent for paths

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent appearance
- May contain weed seeds
- Decomposes faster than bark mulch
- Not ideal for formal gardens

**Cost:** Free to $20 per cubic yard

### Compost

**Best for:** Vegetable gardens, annual beds, soil improvement

Compost acts as both mulch and soil amendment, feeding plants as it breaks down.

**Pros:**
- Improves soil structure
- Adds nutrients
- Encourages beneficial soil organisms
- Can be made at home

**Cons:**
- Needs frequent replenishing
- Can contain weed seeds if not properly composted
- Less effective at weed suppression
- May attract pests if not fully decomposed

**Cost:** $30-60 per cubic yard (or free if homemade)

### Leaf Mulch

**Best for:** Woodland gardens, around acid-loving plants, winter protection

Shredded fall leaves make excellent mulch and are completely free.

**Pros:**
- Free and abundant on Vancouver Island
- Excellent for soil health
- Perfect for woodland gardens
- Good winter protection

**Cons:**
- Can mat down if not shredded
- May blow away
- Decomposes quickly
- Less attractive in formal settings

**Cost:** Free

### Straw

**Best for:** Vegetable gardens, strawberry beds, winter protection

A traditional choice for food gardens.

**Pros:**
- Excellent for vegetable gardens
- Keeps produce clean
- Good insulation
- Affordable

**Cons:**
- May contain weed seeds
- Not attractive for ornamental beds
- Blows around easily
- Needs replacement each season

**Cost:** $8-15 per bale

## Inorganic Mulch Options

### Gravel/River Rock

**Best for:** Xeriscaping, drainage areas, Mediterranean gardens, pathways

**Pros:**
- Permanent (never needs replacing)
- Excellent drainage
- Low maintenance
- Various colors and sizes available

**Cons:**
- Doesn't improve soil
- Can be difficult to plant through
- Gets hot in summer sun
- Weeds can still grow through

**Cost:** $40-100 per cubic yard

### Landscape Fabric

**Best for:** Under gravel or rock, pathways

Often used in combination with other mulches.

**Pros:**
- Effective weed barrier initially
- Works well under rock mulch

**Cons:**
- Breaks down over time
- Can become visible
- Prevents soil improvement
- Difficult to add plants later

**Cost:** $15-30 per roll

## How Much Mulch Do You Need?

For effective coverage, apply mulch 2-4 inches deep:

| Area Size | Cubic Yards Needed (3" depth) |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| 100 sq ft | 1 cubic yard |
| 250 sq ft | 2.5 cubic yards |
| 500 sq ft | 5 cubic yards |
| 1000 sq ft | 10 cubic yards |

## Mulching Best Practices

### Do:
- Leave a gap around tree trunks and plant stems
- Apply 2-4 inches deep (not more)
- Mulch in spring after soil warms
- Top up as needed throughout the year
- Pull weeds before mulching

### Don't:
- Create "mulch volcanoes" around trees
- Pile mulch against house foundations
- Use fresh wood chips directly in planting beds
- Apply mulch over wet, compacted soil
- Mulch over weeds (they'll grow through)

## Best Mulch for Specific Applications

| Application | Recommended Mulch |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Foundation plantings | Bark mulch |
| Vegetable gardens | Compost, straw |
| Rose beds | Composted bark |
| Pathways | Arborist chips, gravel |
| Around trees | Arborist chips, bark mulch |
| Woodland gardens | Leaf mulch |
| Drought-tolerant gardens | Gravel, coarse bark |
