Spring on Vancouver Island brings longer days, warmer temperatures, and the perfect conditions for your lawn to thrive. Here's how to get your yard ready for the growing season.

## When to Start Spring Lawn Care

In the Greater Victoria area and Cowichan Valley, you can typically start spring lawn care in mid-to-late March. Watch for these signs:

- Daytime temperatures consistently above 10°C
- Soil is no longer waterlogged from winter rains
- Grass begins showing new green growth

## Essential Spring Tasks

### 1. Clean Up Winter Debris

Before anything else, clear your lawn of:

- Fallen branches and twigs
- Dead leaves that accumulated over winter
- Any debris blown in during storms

This allows sunlight and air to reach the grass and prevents mold growth.

### 2. Rake and Dethatch

Light raking helps remove the layer of dead grass (thatch) that can prevent water and nutrients from reaching the roots. On Vancouver Island, our wet winters can compact this layer significantly.

### 3. First Mowing of the Season

For your first mow:

- Set your mower blade higher than usual (about 3-4 inches)
- Only remove the top third of the grass blade
- Ensure your mower blade is sharp for clean cuts

### 4. Address Bare Patches

Spring is the ideal time to overseed bare or thin areas. The mild Vancouver Island climate gives new grass the moisture it needs to establish before summer.

### 5. Apply a Light Fertilizer

A balanced spring fertilizer helps your lawn recover from winter dormancy. Look for a formula designed for coastal BC conditions.

## Common Spring Lawn Problems on Vancouver Island

### Moss Growth

Our wet winters create perfect conditions for moss. If you notice moss taking over:

- Improve drainage in problem areas
- Reduce shade where possible
- Consider aerating compacted soil

### Chafer Beetle Damage

European chafer beetles are common in the Victoria area. Signs include:

- Brown patches that pull up easily
- Crows and other birds digging at your lawn
- Visible white grubs when you pull back turf

Address chafer damage by reseeding affected areas and considering nematode treatments in late summer.

## When to Call a Professional
