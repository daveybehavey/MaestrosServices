If your driveway is rough, soft, or holding water, the first question is usually:

**Do I need grading, or do I need new gravel?**

Most properties need one of these two paths, and sometimes both.

## Quick Rule of Thumb

- Choose **grading** when the driveway has decent material but poor shape.
- Choose a **gravel refresh** when the top layer is thin, patchy, or breaking down.

## Signs You Likely Need Driveway Grading

Grading is often the right call when you notice:

- Ruts from repeated wheel paths
- Washboarding or uneven sections
- Water pooling in low spots
- Gravel pushed to edges with a weak center

In these cases, the main issue is profile and drainage, not total material volume.

## Signs You Likely Need a Gravel Refresh

A refresh is usually better when:

- Stone depth has become too thin in traffic zones
- Surface feels soft or muddy after rain
- You can see mixed old material and bare spots
- Repeated spot fixes do not last

Here, new aggregate plus final grading gives a stronger result.

## When You Need Both

Many Vancouver Island driveways benefit from:

1. Re-shaping for better runoff
2. Adding fresh aggregate in weak areas
3. Final leveling and compaction

This is common on rural properties and longer private driveways where drainage and wear vary by section.

## Seasonal Timing on Vancouver Island

The most practical window is usually:

- **Spring to early fall** for best material handling and finish quality

Wet periods can still be workable for urgent fixes, but full reshaping and surface finishing is usually cleaner in drier conditions.

## Not Sure Which One You Need?

If you can share:

- Approximate driveway length
- Main problem areas (puddles, ruts, soft spots)
- Whether you want a quick fix or a longer-lasting reset
