Vancouver Island's dry summers can stress even the healthiest lawns. Knowing how much and when to water makes the difference between a brown, dormant lawn and a green, thriving one.

## The Basic Rule

Most lawns on Vancouver Island need about **1 inch of water per week** during summer months. This includes any rainfall, so you'll need to adjust based on weather.

However, how you deliver that water matters as much as the amount.

## Deep and Infrequent vs. Light and Often

The biggest mistake homeowners make is watering lightly every day. This encourages shallow root growth and makes grass more susceptible to drought stress.

**Instead, water deeply 1-2 times per week:**

- Deep watering encourages roots to grow down
- Deep roots access moisture even during hot spells
- Less frequent watering reduces disease risk

## How to Measure 1 Inch of Water

Use the "tuna can test":

1. Place empty tuna cans (or similar containers) around your lawn
2. Run your sprinkler system
3. Time how long it takes to collect 1 inch of water
4. Use this timing for future watering sessions

Most sprinkler systems take 30-60 minutes to deliver 1 inch of water.

## Best Time to Water

**Early morning (5-9 AM) is ideal:**

- Less evaporation than midday watering
- Grass blades dry before evening, reducing disease
- Water pressure is typically better
- Follows natural dew patterns

**Avoid evening watering** - Grass that stays wet overnight is more prone to fungal diseases.

## Watering Restrictions on Vancouver Island

Many municipalities implement summer watering restrictions. Common rules include:

- Specific watering days based on your address
- Morning-only watering hours
- Restrictions on runoff

Check your local municipality for current restrictions:

- Greater Victoria: CRD watering regulations
- Cowichan Valley: CVRD water restrictions
- Nanaimo Regional District: Specific community rules

## Signs Your Lawn Needs Water

Don't just water on a schedule. Look for these signs:

**Footprint test** - Walk across your lawn. If footprints remain visible for more than a few seconds, your lawn needs water.

**Color change** - Grass that needs water takes on a blue-gray tinge before turning brown.

**Blade curl** - Grass blades curl or fold lengthwise when moisture-stressed.

**Soil test** - Push a screwdriver into the soil. If it's difficult to push in 6 inches, the soil is too dry.

## Adjusting for Soil Type

Vancouver Island has varied soil conditions:

### Sandy Soil (common near beaches)
- Drains quickly
- May need watering twice per week
- Water for shorter periods more frequently

### Clay Soil (common in Saanich, parts of Victoria)
- Drains slowly
- Water once per week, longer duration
- Watch for runoff and pause if needed

### Loamy Soil (ideal)
- Balanced drainage
- Standard 1 inch per week works well

## Shade vs. Sun

Shaded lawns need less water:

- **Full sun**: 1 inch per week
- **Partial shade**: 0.75 inch per week
- **Heavy shade**: 0.5 inch per week

Overwatering shaded areas promotes moss and fungal problems.

## Should You Let Your Lawn Go Dormant?

During extended dry periods, you have two choices:

### Option 1: Maintain Green
- Continue regular deep watering
- Higher water bills
- Constant care required

### Option 2: Allow Dormancy
- Stop watering (grass turns brown)
- Lawn survives on minimal moisture
- Greens up when rain returns
- More water-efficient

If you choose dormancy:
- Give the lawn one deep watering every 3-4 weeks to keep roots alive
- Avoid foot traffic on dormant grass
- Don't fertilize or treat dormant lawns

## Summer Watering Schedule Example

Here's a sample schedule for Greater Victoria:

| Week | Rainfall | Supplemental Watering |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| Dry week (0") | None | Two 30-minute sessions |
| Light rain (0.5") | 0.5" | One 30-minute session |
| Good rain (1"+) | 1"+ | None needed |

## Water Conservation Tips

- **Mulch garden beds** to reduce overall landscape water needs
- **Raise mowing height** in summer (taller grass shades soil)
- **Fix leaks** in irrigation systems promptly
- **Use rain barrels** where permitted
- **Choose drought-tolerant plants** for new landscaping

## Common Summer Watering Mistakes

1. **Watering every day** - Creates shallow roots
2. **Evening watering** - Promotes disease
3. **Ignoring restrictions** - Can result in fines
4. **Not adjusting for rain** - Wastes water
5. **Uniform watering everywhere** - Shaded areas need less
