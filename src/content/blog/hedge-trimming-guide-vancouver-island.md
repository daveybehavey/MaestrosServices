Well-maintained hedges define property boundaries, provide privacy, and add structure to your landscape. On Vancouver Island, our mild climate allows hedges to grow vigorously, which means regular trimming is essential to keep them looking their best.

## When to Trim Hedges

The timing of hedge trimming depends on the species and your goals:

### Formal Hedges (2-3 times per year)

Formal hedges with crisp, geometric shapes need frequent trimming:

- **Late spring (May-June)** - After the main growth flush
- **Mid-summer (July-August)** - To maintain shape
- **Early fall (September)** - Final shaping before winter

### Informal Hedges (1-2 times per year)

Informal or natural hedges need less frequent attention:

- **Late winter/early spring** - Before new growth begins
- **After flowering** - For flowering hedges

## Common Hedge Species on Vancouver Island

### Laurel (Cherry Laurel, Portuguese Laurel)

**When to trim:** Late spring and late summer
**Growth rate:** Fast (1-2 feet per year)
**Notes:** Very common on Vancouver Island. Can handle heavy pruning if needed.

### Cedar (Western Red Cedar, Emerald Cedar)

**When to trim:** Late spring to mid-summer
**Growth rate:** Moderate (6-12 inches per year)
**Notes:** Don't cut into old wood—it won't regrow. Trim regularly to maintain density.

### Boxwood

**When to trim:** Late spring and again in late summer
**Growth rate:** Slow (3-6 inches per year)
**Notes:** Tolerates heavy shaping. Watch for boxwood blight in our wet climate.

### Privet

**When to trim:** Multiple times through growing season
**Growth rate:** Very fast (2-3 feet per year)
**Notes:** Needs frequent trimming on Vancouver Island due to our long growing season.

### Photinia (Red Tip)

**When to trim:** After new red growth matures (late spring), again in summer
**Growth rate:** Fast (1-2 feet per year)
**Notes:** Trim to encourage more red new growth.

### Yew

**When to trim:** Late spring to early summer
**Growth rate:** Slow to moderate (6-12 inches per year)
**Notes:** One of the few evergreens that regrows from old wood.

### Escallonia

**When to trim:** After flowering (late summer)
**Growth rate:** Moderate
**Notes:** Popular in coastal areas. Prune after blooms fade.

## Hedge Trimming Best Practices

### Shape Matters

The ideal hedge shape is slightly narrower at the top than the bottom. This allows:

- Sunlight to reach lower branches
- Even growth throughout the hedge
- Snow to slide off (less relevant on Vancouver Island, but still good practice)

### The One-Third Rule

Never remove more than one-third of the hedge in a single trimming. Cutting too much causes:

- Stress to the plant
- Brown patches
- Slow recovery
- Potential die-back

### Tools for the Job

**Hand shears** - Best for small hedges and detailed work
**Electric hedge trimmers** - Good for most residential hedges
**Gas-powered trimmers** - Necessary for large or tough hedges
**Loppers** - For thicker branches inside the hedge

### Cutting Technique

1. Start at the bottom and work up
2. Use smooth, sweeping motions
3. Step back frequently to check your work
4. Cut at a slight angle to shed water

## Renovating Overgrown Hedges

If a hedge has gotten out of control, you have options:

### Gradual Renovation (Preferred)

1. Cut one side back hard in year one
2. Let it regrow
3. Cut the other side back in year two
4. Resume normal trimming

### Hard Pruning

Some species (laurel, yew, privet) can be cut back severely and will regrow. Others (cedar, cypress) won't recover from cutting into old wood.

**Species that tolerate hard pruning:**
- Laurel
- Yew
- Privet
- Boxwood
- Photinia

**Species that don't:**
- Cedar
- Cypress
- Most conifers

## Hedge Care Tips for Vancouver Island

### Managing Growth in Our Climate

Our mild, wet climate means extended growing seasons. Plan for:

- Earlier start to trimming (April instead of May)
- Possible need for an extra trim in mild years
- More vigorous growth near the coast

### Dealing with Pests and Disease

**Common issues:**

- **Leaf spot diseases** - Improve air circulation by not letting hedges get too dense
- **Scale insects** - Check the undersides of leaves regularly
- **Spider mites** - More common in dry summers

### Feeding Hedges

Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring to support healthy growth. Avoid fertilizing in late summer, which can encourage soft growth vulnerable to frost.

## When to Call a Professional

Consider professional hedge trimming when:

- Hedges are too tall to reach safely
- You need power tools you don't own
- The hedge is severely overgrown
- You want crisp, professional results
- You simply don't have the time
