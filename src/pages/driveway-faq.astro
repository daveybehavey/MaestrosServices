    question: "How do I know if I need driveway grading or new gravel?",
    answer:
      "If material is still present but shape is poor, grading is usually the first step. If the surface is thin, patchy, or soft, a gravel refresh is often needed alongside grading.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can driveway grading fix puddles?",
    answer:
      "Often yes. Recurring puddles usually come from low spots and poor runoff profile. Regrading can restore crown and slope so water sheds more effectively.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical driveway job take?",
    answer:
      "Many small to mid-size grading or refresh projects are completed within one day, depending on driveway length, access, and material needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "When is the best time of year for driveway work?",
    answer:
      "Spring through fall is usually best for finishing and compaction conditions on Vancouver Island, though urgent corrections can still be handled outside peak season.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle full driveway rebuilds?",
    answer:
      "We handle many small to mid-size rebuild and refresh projects. For larger engineered scopes, we assess and confirm fit during quoting.",
  },
  {
    question: "What details should I send for a faster quote?",
    answer:
      "Share driveway length/width, main problem areas, whether puddling repeats, and whether you want a short-term fix or longer-term reset.",
